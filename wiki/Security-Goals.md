# Security Goals

Str Wallet is designed with these goals in mind for security:

### Social (people)
- **Resilient**. Funds are recoverable through time locks and multiple safety nets. No single point of failure such as thefts, cracks, loss, censorship or coersions is catastrophic. 
- **Sufficient**. All steps are well defined without delegating to hardware devices or seed phrases in safety boxes. Users do not need any passwords or rely on biometrics.
- **Anonymous**. An account is a fresh cryptographic hash, not tied to existing systems or real-world identity. Derived paths support multiple public keys to protect privacy.

### Smart (code)
- **Composable**. One-time or low-entropy passwords are useful for small funds. Multiple authentications can independently boost protection thresholds against brute-force.
- **On-chain**. A decentralized network with high stakes and fast finality validates all transactions. Its platform has sustainable incentives and open governance to evolve. 
- **Programmable**. Operations can call third-party contracts, store history of states, or upgrade its code. Complex applications may use oracles of time, locations and events.

### Hard (math)
- **Self-Sovereign**. No third parties, government documents, designated guardians, backup servers or hardware enclaves are necessary. Users have full custody and self control.
- **Air-Gapped**. Key-loggers and man-in-the-middle attacks are minimized. The full parameters of transactions are easy to verify and approve without cables or cameras.
- **Verified**. Trusted are only open source and hardened cryptography. Formal verification, through logical frameworks, assures end-to-end security beyond tests and audits.


# Tradeoffs

There may be conflicts, tradeoffs or impracticality of the goals above. Here's our rule of thumb:
1. Toward validating our innovation with 10k users (each with $100 assets), focus on these three goals: **sufficient, resilient and composable**. 
1. Toward adopting our product with 1m users (each with $1k assets), differentiate with these three goals: **on-chain, self-sovereign and air-gapped**.
